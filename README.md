# ASI Challenge
### Naive Bayes Classification and Bayesian Linear Regression on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
This repository contains the notebook for the ASI (Advanced Statistical Inference) course challenge, developed during the
last semester of the Data Science and Engineering track at EURECOM.

The aim of the challenge is to try simple image classification models with the
[Fashion-MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data)
and the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets.

The models that will be used are the [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
and the [Bayesian Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression). Both of them have been
written from scratch, to fully understand their internal behaviour.
